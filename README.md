# A-Note-on-Exact-State-Visit-Probabilities-in-Two-State-Markov-Chains

This note derives the probability that a specific state in a two-state Markov chain is visited exactly $k$ times after $N$ transitions. We provide a closed-form solution for $\mathbb{P}(N_l = k \mid N)$, considering initial state probabilities and transition dynamics. The solution corrects and extends prior incomplete results, offering a rigorous framework for enumerating state transitions.
